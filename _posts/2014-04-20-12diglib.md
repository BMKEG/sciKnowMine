title: The SciKnowMine Triage Application
description:  We present here a user manual for running and maintaining a web-based system for peforming document triage given a corpus of PDF files. We will describe processes for installation, execution and maintenance of the system.

Once the documents have been selected for inclusion in a particular corpus, then more
detailed information extraction and annotation can be performed. This work is still at 
an early stage but is intended as a core functionality for the SciKnowMine system. In 
particular, we anticipate using Information Extraction to locate and extract passages of 
interest within the system.

The screenshot shows a specific target corpus selected for the MGI-driven use-case: 
'Allele Phenotype'. The user may *annotate* passages in the text by clicking, dragging 
and releasing the mouse over the document. These two selected passages shown are the 
main claims of the paper shown. In particular, we anticipate the use of the [BioC 
annotation standard](http://bioc.sourceforge.net/) to support sharing and structuring
these `fragment` elements.

By focusing on PDF files as a common *de-facto* publication standard that most 
scientists are comfortable using, we hope to develop knowledge engineering and text 
mining applications that scientists find intuitively useful in the execution of their 
day-to-day work. We also intend that our tools are portable and modular so that they 
may be incorporated into other developers' systems.
