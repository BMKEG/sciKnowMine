Web Application - Running the System
---

The command line system provides preliminary data management capabilities for
SciKnowMine but the web application brings together the elements as a whole. 

See the [SciKnowMine Web Application github page](https://github.com/BMKEG/sciKnowMine) for 
instructions on how to install and run the system from source (Recommended).

From the top page, click on the `Run the system` button to start SciKnowMine.
The SciKnowMine Triage system will start with a dashboard, shown below.

The panel on the left shows `TriageCorpus` objects (collections to be sorted into 
categories, in this case showing the work of one curator: Hiroaki Onda). The list on the
right shows the category that they are being assigned to. This is the base function of the 
system. Clicking the `>>>` button transfers newly assigned papers across all the triage 
corpora to their assigned categories. 

The links at the top of the page show the different modules that form the main 
functionality of the system. 

* Upload/Triage Papers - provides the primary function of the system
* Extract text - systems for accurately extracting text from PDF files.
* Digital library - general bibliographic management once the papers have been triaged.

We will focus on the [text extraction first](10extractingText), followed by 
[the triage task](11triage) followed by 
the more general functionality of [the digital library](12diglib).
