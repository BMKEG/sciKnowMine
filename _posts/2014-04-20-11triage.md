Web Application - Performing the triage task
---

The goal of this application is to accelerate the process of document triage for 
biocurators by providing document classification cues to the biocurator using the 
system. Within the tool, this consists of listing the documents so that they can be 
scored easily and showing cues to features within each document that support the 
classification. 

The triage component requires that the user select a `Triage Corpus` (such as Hiroaki 
Onda as shown), which then lists the documents in the corpus, cross-referenced to inclusions 
codes for each corpus in the system (`+`, `-` or `?`).

If a trained classifier has been  run on the documents in a given triage corpus, 
a score will have been generated for the 
document in this context. This shows as a green bar next to the code selection. The 
system also permits the user to sort the columns of the table in descending order of 
this score by clicking on a triage corpus heading (and the system removes all other data 
for the documents shown). This is shown below.

The selected paper shown is a previously-unseen document with the highest classification 
score available. The view of the PDF file shows the body of the PDF file with all 
instances of the words `mouse`, `mice` or `murine` highlighted. This acts as an important 
cue for Mouse Genome Informatics curators and will be changed when the system is applied 
to other datasets. 

Training and running the classifiers from within the system at the present time is 
based only on an SVMLite bigram classifier. In order to train a classifier, the user must 
select a Corpus name (the target of the classification) and click the `Train...` button. 
The system will create a modal feedback popup and report on execution progress since this 
step takes time. Similarly, to use the classifier to predict inclusion of individual 
papers, the user must select a both the Corpus's classifier and a Triage Corpus to run 
over before clicking the `Predict...` button.
