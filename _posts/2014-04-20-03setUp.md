Command Line Tools - Setting Up
-----------------------

Once installed, the system permits two modes of use: (A) using 
*command-line tools to administer the server, and upload/process scientific articles into corpora* and 
(B) use the *web interface to assign articles to specific corpora*. 

### Setting up the swfTools directory

The system uses the `pdf2swf` command to convert PDF files to the SWF file for displaying in 
FlexPaper (http://flexpaper.devaldi.com/). We therefore have to identify to the system where to find 
the pdf2swf executable with the following command.

```
setSwfToolsBinDirectory </path/to/pdf2swf/executable>
```

### Building a triage database

This step has to be executed only once.

The triage system stores all of its data in a MySQL database. This includes articles content, classification
codes, and how they are organized into collections (corpora). Before using the triage system you
need to create a trage database using one of the triage commands pre-installed in your system.

In order to execute this command you must select a name and use a suitable login name and password 
for existing user with suitable permissions. 

```
buildTriageDatabase -db <name-of-database> -l <login> -p <password>        
 -db DBNAME : Database name
 -l LOGIN   : Database login
 -p PASSWD  : Database password
```

### Destroying a triage database

Removing a database from the system involves a similar command to the one creating it.

```
destroyTriageDatabase -db <name-of-database> -l <login> -p <password>        
 -db DBNAME : Database name
 -l LOGIN   : Database login
 -p PASSWD  : Database password
```
